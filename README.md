# My Telegram Bot

A simple and efficient Telegram bot built using Python to automate tasks, interact with users, and provide useful services directly on Telegram.

## Features
- **Automated Responses**: The bot replies to specific user commands with pre-defined responses.
- **Interactive Commands**: Users can trigger actions like fetching data, sending notifications, or getting random content.
- **Easy to Customize**: Adjust the bot’s responses and commands with minimal effort.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. **Telegram Bot Token**: You can get this by creating a bot through [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
3. **Libraries**: The bot requires some Python libraries. These can be installed via pip.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/My-Telegram-Bot.git
cd My-Telegram-Bot
```

### Install dependencies
Use the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up environment variables
You will need to provide your bot’s token as an environment variable. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
```

### Run the bot
```bash
python bot.py
```

### Hosting (Optional)
You can host the bot on a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or any server that supports Python. Make sure to configure your webhook properly when doing so.

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it on Telegram by sending commands. Some examples:
- `/start`: Starts the interaction with the bot.
- `/help`: Shows available commands and how to use them.
- `/randomfact`: Fetches a random fact.

Feel free to customize the bot by adding new commands or improving functionality.

## Customization

To add more commands or functionality:
1. Open the `bot.py` file.
2. Find the section where commands are defined.
3. Add a new function for your command and register it.

For example:
```python
@bot.message_handler(commands=['newcommand'])
def new_command(message):
    bot.reply_to(message, "This is a new command!")
```

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixed.



### Additional Notes:
- You might want to include detailed documentation for specific commands or APIs the bot interacts with.
- Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes all dependencies (e.g., `python-telegram-bot`, `dotenv`).
